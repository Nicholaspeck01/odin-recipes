    <h2>A delicous Detroit style pizza!</h2>
    <p>Forget the old Chicago vs. NY debate! America's best pizza could very well be Detroit-style pizza.
        Even though it's often referred to as 'deep dish,' I don't think that accurately captures the essence
        of this crispy, crusty, crazy-good slice. It has flavor elements of a slightly charred thin-crust pizza, 
        with the texture of light, airy focaccia. Plus, if you use the properly shaped pan, the edges of your 
        crust get wonderfully crunchy, making for a truly unique experience.
